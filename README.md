# Java-Based Chat Application with Socket Programming
This is a demonstration project aimed at solidifying knowledge of Java in the development of client-server applications with a GUI.

    
## About The Project
 Chat System allows users to communicate in real-time using web sockets.
 
As part of the project, the following components were created:
   
- A server for exchanging text messages, allowing users to interact with each other in real-time.
- A console client that is capable of connecting to the server and exchanging messages with other participants, providing basic chat functionality.
- A bot client that can receive requests and send data about the current date and time, adding extra features for users.
- A chat client with a graphical user interface, which offers a more convenient and visual way to interact with the server and other chat participants.
    
These components work together to create a comprehensive messaging system.

## Improvements
In this version, the following interface enhancements have been made:
- Implemented a "Exit" button for easy exit from the chat.
- Added notifications for when users join or leave the chat, improving interaction among participants.
- Introduced the ability to address specific users, allowing for more precise and effective communication in the chat.

## Getting Started
- Start the Server class, specifying the port (for example, 1234).
- Start the ClientGuiController class, entering the server address as 'localhost' and the port specified in step 1.
- Launch the chatbot.

## Conclusion
In the course of this project, I successfully strengthened and expanded my skills in the following areas:
- Working with sockets for network communication
- Utilizing serialization and deserialization of data
- Creating multithreaded applications and synchronizing them
- Applying classes from the java.util.concurrent library for thread management
I also implemented the MVC pattern, utilized inner and nested classes, and use of the Calendar and SimpleDateFormat classes. Furthermore, I worked with the Swing library to develop the graphical user interface.

This experience significantly enhanced my programming skills and deepened my understanding of Java development.
